      "The “Bundespreis für Kunststudierende” (Federal Award for Art Students) honours students from various disciplines at Germany’s 24 art colleges every two years.",
      "The competition was organised by the German Student Union and funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.",
      "Our team contributed the visual identity of the exhibition catalogue, the website, posters and invitation cards.",
      "Tragic events, social and political unrest and a pandemic shaped the past few years that required a reflection of one’s values and priorities.",
      "In a post-truth setting, we have to rethink the handling of information.",
      "Our design concept “Infodemic” plays with this overload of data—images and text line up en masse—visualizing the news streams that reach us daily.",
      "The artists, though, represent positions that can be silver linings on the horizon, encouraging us to look behind the cacophonic curtain."

      "My complaint is not an isolated case, but why is it treated as such?",
      "In three parts, my experience of being stereotyped and fetishized as a racialized person is described as self-written texts.",
      "These text snippets are embedded between text extracts from decolonial theory with quotes from Stuart Hall, bell hooks, and Sara Ahmed.",
      "The crucial factor for this combination of texts was my realization that often personal experiences of discrimination are not taken seriously because they often have an emotional tone."
